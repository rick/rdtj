- jukebox_player.pl: backend now supports multiple queues

date: 2001/01/08 11:02:11;  author: roundeye
- index.php is showing up modified, but a diff shows nothing; presumably this
  is a timestamp/clock issue
- moved upgrades/tables_1.1-1.2.sql to upgrades/tables_0.1-0.2.sql, which is
  what it should have been called in the first place
- added upgrades/tables_0.2,0.3-0.4.sql to allow migration between 0.[23] and 0.4
  which will include multi-player support

date: 2001/01/08 10:54:05;  author: roundeye
- added "force artist" and "force album" commands to add script

date: 2000/11/02 14:41:07;  author: roundeye
- tiny interface usability change -- when submitting songs, keep the
  proper expansion (artist expanded / album expanded) but on reload jump
  to the album from the submitted song (reduces scrolling for multi-album
  artists)

date: 2000/11/01 13:00:23;  author: roundeye
- wired 'add' up to the database
- added code to only add mp3's which are not already in the database.

date: 2000/10/24 13:26:18;  author: roundeye

  english single-letter frequency data
- add: working on cleanup/final heuristics

date: 2000/10/16 19:59:39;  author: roundeye

[ RDTJ 0.3 released ]

date: 2000/10/16 13:33:46;  author: roundeye
- insert_album: fixed minor bug with insert_album:  it was intended to 
  be run for one album at a time, but it turns out that it works *almost* perfectly for
  multiple albums at once (perl insert_albums list1 list2 list3 ...)
  except for the fact that the album sort order field doesn't reset on
  album boundaries.  Sort order is still correct but instead of each album
  having tracks numbered 1, 2, 3... they continue on upwards.

date: 2000/10/16 13:06:43;  author: roundeye

date: 2000/10/15 10:37:51;  author: roundeye
